# PantherNFT_Final_Project
## By: Luc Rieffel, Emily Nguyen, and Michelle Zhang

### Motivation: We wanted to learn more about NFT's and how they are made and deployed. In order to learn we created the beginning of a Chapman University themed NFT project. 

### No significant references

### Instructions: Simply run and compile the PantherNFT.sol file to test the code. 

### Documentation: The contract works and was successfully deployed. We were also able to add it to the Deno platform to receive donations for the open source aspect of our project.

### Future improvements: Add more NFT's to the project and work on a front end interface for users to buy NFT's
